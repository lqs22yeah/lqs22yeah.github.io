## ðŸ‘¤ BIO

I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student in the Department of Electronic Engineering at Tsinghua University. I began my research journey at [NICSEFC](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. [Yu Wang](https://web.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/wangyu) and Dr. [Zhenhua Zhu](https://nicsefc.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/people/ZhenhuaZhu). At present, I am also a research intern at the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/index.shtml), Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. [Phillip Gibbons](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~gibbons/) and collaborating closely with Prof. [Guy Blelloch](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~guyb/).
