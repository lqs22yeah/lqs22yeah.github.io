During my undergraduate research, I developed orchestration algorithms, programming systems, and compilers, and accelerated DNNs and LLMs on emerging hardware platforms, including Processing-in-Memory, Computing-in-Memory, and Distributed Memory systems. My work has focused on two key challenges: handling data movement and exploiting hardware parallelism.",
